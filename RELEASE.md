# H2O Authn Release Process

- Releases are handled by [Release Please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please)
[GitHub Action](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please-action) that executes on
  all commits to the default branch.
- Commits to the default branch should follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) syntax.
- If the default branch contains commits that lead to the increment of a version number Release Please
  will automatically create a PR that when merged will create a new release.
- Release PR is created by the GitHub Action bot as a draft, which means that CI checks are not automatically triggered.
- To activate the PR non-bot maintainer needs to contribute to the PR.
  - This can usually be done by adding an empty commit and pushing it to the PR branch.

     ```sh
      git commit --allow-empty --message "Activate release PR"
      git push
     ```
